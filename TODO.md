# To do
- ~~Filter calendar on task selection.~~
- ~~Make this my new tab screen, if possible.~~
- Move icons to each row. Add a reset button, too, then. Be specific? Reset view. Or something. Or add a(n) (un)select all button.
- Make the green on the calendar a gradient depending on how many tasks were completed.
- Make the task name editable.
- Show checkboxes/delete only when an "edit" button is click + necessary styling changes.
- Click on date on calendar to show that day's activites.
- Make adding a task more clear.
- Change years.
- Some sort of hover functionality over the calendar dates.
- Make prettier.
- Maybe add another color for the PASSed tasks.
